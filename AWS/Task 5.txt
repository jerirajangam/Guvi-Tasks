Deploy a simple web application using AWS code commit, code build and deploy & access via browser and automate via codepipeline.

Code Commit is not available for new user, so i used github.
1. Created a basic html code to display details and uploaded in github.
2. created a codebuild and attached the github source file.
3. created s3 bucket and EC2 instance. In EC2 Instance installed necessary packages to deploy code like codedeploy-agent package.
4. Also created roles and policies that are required and attached it the EC2 Instance.
5. created a application, deployment group and code deploy, to deploy the basic details.
6. created a codepipeline and deployed it. It got succeeded.
7. Finally I checked it using the public ip of the EC2 Instance via browser.
