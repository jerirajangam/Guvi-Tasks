Set up a VPC with an Internet gateway, create a public subnet with 256 IP addresses, a private subnet with 256 IP addresses,
make a route table connecting the Internet gateway and the subnets, and launch a Linux EC2 instance by using the above VPC and public subnet.

#First I Created a VPC named Guvi-VPC & Entered CIDR Block - 192.168.0.0/22 - 1022 

#Then I Created Public Subnet named Guvi-PublicSubnet & selected myvpc(Guvi-VPC) & set the CIDR block with 256 IPs - 192.168.0.0/24 

#Then I Created Private Subnet named Guvi-PrivateSubnet & selected myvpc(Guvi-VPC) & set the CIDR block with 256 IPs - 192.168.1.0/24

#Then I  Created an Internet Gateway named Guvi-IGW and attached it to MyVPC


#Then I Create a Route Table named Guvi-PublicRT for Public Subnet and Edited the route by adding the InternetGateway.
 And Associated the Subnet with PublicSubnet.

#Then I  Created an NAT Gateway named Guvi-NAT and attached it to MyVPC

#I Create a Route Table named Guvi-PrivateRT for Private Subnet and Edited the route by adding the NatGateway.
 And Associated the Subnet with PrivateSubnet.


#I Launched a Linux EC2 Instance with Amazon Linux and Edited the Network by Adding the MyVPC and subnets.
 then edited the security group of the instance by allowing the ssh port. Then Connected the EC2 Instance using Putty.
