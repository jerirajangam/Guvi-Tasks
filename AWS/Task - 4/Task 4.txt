Launch an EC2 instance (Linux and Windows) along with a web server. Then, create an EBS volume of 5 GB, attach it to an EC2 machine (Linux and Windows),
and take a snapshot. Finally, create an EBS volume using the taken snapshot.


Linux Based EC2-Instance
=========================

1. I created an EC2-Instance using Amazon Linux & connected using putty and installed httpd web server.
2. In Elastic Block Store, I selected Volumes and created a new volume with 5GB and attached it to the EC2 Instance.
3. After attaching the volume I formated the disk to make it available.
4. Then I came back to the volume and created a snapshot from the volume.
5. After creating SNAPSHOT, I created a volume using snapshot and attached the snapshot volume to the EC2 Instance. 
   then repeated the same steps to format the volume.


Windows Based EC2-Instance
=========================

1. I created an EC2-Instance using Windows and connected using RDP and installed web server(IIS).
2. In Elastic Block Store, I selected Volumes and created a new volume with 5GB and attached it to the EC2 Instance.
3. After attaching the volume I formated the disk to make it available.
4. Then I came back to the volume and created a snapshot from the volume.
5. After creating SNAPSHOT, I created a volume using snapshot and attached the snapshot volume to the EC2 Instance. 
   then repeated the same steps to format the volume.
