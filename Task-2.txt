Create the K8s EKS,further you have to do the deployment of the Nginx application and 
access the application outside the cluster.

I created k8s EKS using both local and AWS EC2 Instance and deployed NGINX application and accessed outside 
the cluster.

1. I checked and installed AWS-CLI, eksctl and kubectl using official documentation.
2. Next I created EKS cluster.
3. Then I deployed nginx application using both the setup.
4. I port forwared the application to a target port and accessed outside the cluster.
