Create a simple script file and push it to repo. Create a project in Jenkins connected to your GitHub repository.
When a commit is made to your repo, automatically build must get triggered from Jenkins and the output must be shared to me via email.

# First I created a script file named task2.sh, then added few lines in the file and commited it and pushed it to GIT Repo
  with the name JENKINS.

# Then I created a Jenkins Pipeline and enabled SMTP Server, APP Password in google account to configure the mail and entered the SMTP details 
  in Dashboard --> Manage Jenkins --> System. 

# After Enabling and configuring the SMTP server and saving the pipeline script. I made a change by adding a line in the SCM,
  to trigger the build using SCM Change. And the Result will be Shared via email.

# I made the Build schedule like, The Build should be triggered only on the second minute after making the change in the SCM.
