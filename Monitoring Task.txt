Install Prometheus and Grafana on a Linux EC2 machine, connect Prometheus to Grafana, and create a dashboard to view metrics.

1. Created an EC2 Instance with Ubuntu OS and Instance type is t2.medium with instance name AWS-Monitoring.
2. Connected to the Instance, then enabled ports to connect Grafana,Prometheus & Node Exporter.
3. First installed Grafana using the official document and using the public ip of the instance logged into the grafana service.
4. Second installed Prometheus using the official document and connected it using public ip of the instance.
5. Third installed Node Exporter using the official document and connected it using public ip of the instance.
6. After completing all the installation I integrated the node with the Prometheus and Integrated prometheus with grafana.
7. Then I imported the Node Exporter Full Metrics dashboard into the grafana to view the metrics.
8. Finally I restarted the Prometheus service, which gave me the metrics of the instance.
