Create a custom docker image for nginx and deploy it using docker compose,
where the volume bind mount should be at /var/opt/nginx location. Push the created custom docker image to your docker-hub.


#First I created a Dockerfile to create docker image for nginx

#Then I created a custom html file to display a message like "WELCOME TO MY CUSTOM NGINX SERVER" in the path /var/opt/nginx and
 I used it as volume bind mount.

# Then I created docker compose file and I used the image from Dockerfile and the content to display from html using the volume bind mount path.

# Then I used docker compose command to run the container and then I added it to the dockerhub registry.
