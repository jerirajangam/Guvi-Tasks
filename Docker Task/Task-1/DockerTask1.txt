Task Description:

Install docker on EC2 and explore the docker commands (docker images, containers, volumes, network)

 # First I created an Instance in AWS
 # Then I installed docker in the Instance, using
	yum update
	yum install docker
 # Then I checked if the DOCKER is installed or not using,
	docker --version  ---> This command will give only information about version
	docker version    ---> This command will give informations about CLIENT & SERVER
	docker info       ---> This command will give informations about DOCKER HOST,DAEMON & SERVER INFORMATION
   Incase if we are not getting the informations about the server, we need to START the docker service using,
